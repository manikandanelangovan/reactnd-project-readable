# reactnd-project-readable

This project was bootstrapped with "Create React App"


## Installation Intructions

It's recommendable to open two separate terminal windows, in order to run the server and client separately.

-[`cd server`]
 - [`npm install` To install the dependencies]
 - [`npm start` To start the backend server]

-[`cd frontend`]
  - [`npm install` To install the dependencies]
   - [`npm start` to start the application]

Then open a browser and enter `http://localhost:3000`.
   
## Good to go!!!
